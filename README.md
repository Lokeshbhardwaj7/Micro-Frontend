# Microfrontend Dashboard with Module Federation

A React TypeScript microfrontend application demonstrating Webpack 5 Module Federation with event-driven communication.

## üìã Assignment Requirements Met

- ‚úÖ Shell application with Module Federation configuration
- ‚úÖ User Management microfrontend with CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Analytics microfrontend with event subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Notification microfrontend with pattern matching
- ‚úÖ Type-safe global event bus
- ‚úÖ Error boundaries for isolation
- ‚úÖ Shared theme context
- ‚úÖ Runtime loading of remote modules

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Module Federation Setup
- **Shell App** (Port 3001): Host application that loads remote modules
- **User Management** (Port 3002): Handles user CRUD operations
- **Analytics** (Port 3003): Displays metrics and charts
- **Notifications** (Port 3004): Manages toast notifications

### Event Bus System
- Type-safe custom event bus with wildcard pattern support
- Events include: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`, `user.selected`, `data.refresh`, `theme.changed`, `notification.show`, `notification.clear`

### Shared Dependencies
- React and ReactDOM as singletons
- Shared theme context across all applications
- Type definitions for consistent event handling

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone and setup all applications:**
   ```bash
   # Shell application
   cd shell
   npm install
   npm start

   # User Management (in new terminal)
   cd user-management
   npm install
   npm start

   # Analytics (in new terminal)
   cd analytics
   npm install
   npm start

   # Notifications (in new terminal)
   cd notifications
   npm install
   npm start

Access the applications:

Shell: http://localhost:3001

User Management: http://localhost:3002

Analytics: http://localhost:3003

Notifications: http://localhost:3004

Build for Production:

# In each application folder
npm run build


üìä Event Catalog
Published Events
Event	Source Module	Payload	Description
user.created	User Management	User object	When a new user is created
user.updated	User Management	User object	When a user is updated
user.deleted	User Management	userId: string	When a user is deleted
user.selected	User Management	User object	When a user is selected
data.refresh	Analytics	None	Request to refresh analytics data
theme.changed	Shell	`theme: 'light'	'dark'`	When theme is toggled
notification.show	Any	{message: string, severity: string}	Show a notification
notification.clear	Notifications	notificationId?: string	Clear specific or all notifications
Subscription Mapping
Module	Subscribes To	Handles
Analytics	user.created, user.updated, user.deleted, data.refresh, theme.changed	Updates metrics and charts
Notifications	*.error, *.success, notification.show, notification.clear	Shows toast notifications with pattern matching
üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Strategy
Error Boundaries
Each microfrontend has its own error boundary

Shell has a global error boundary to prevent cascade failures

Errors are contained within the module where they occur

Event Bus Error Handling
Event handlers are wrapped in try-catch blocks

Errors in event handlers don't break other subscribers

Console logging for debugging event flow issues

ü§ñ AI Assistant Usage Log
Interaction 1
Prompt: "How to set up Webpack 5 Module Federation for React TypeScript with separate dev servers?"
AI Response: Provided webpack configuration with ModuleFederationPlugin and dev server setup
Action: Used the configuration with adjustments for specific ports and shared dependencies
Context: Setting up the foundation for microfrontend architecture

Interaction 2
Prompt: "Create a type-safe event bus in TypeScript with wildcard pattern support for custom events"
AI Response: Provided EventBus implementation with type safety and pattern matching
Action: Implemented with additional error handling and cleanup mechanisms
Context: Needed cross-module communication system

Interaction 3
Prompt: "Best practices for error boundaries in React microfrontends with Module Federation"
AI Response: Suggested ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI and error isolation
Action: Created error boundary components for each microfrontend
Context: Ensuring one module's errors don't break others

Interaction 4
Prompt: "How to handle shared theme state across multiple React applications with context"
AI Response: Provided ThemeContext implementation with provider and consumer pattern
Action: Implemented with event bus integration for theme change notifications
Context: Needed consistent theming across microfrontends

Interaction 5
Prompt: "Implement pattern matching for event listeners in a custom event bus"
AI Response: Suggested wildcard event handling with pattern matching logic
Action: Enhanced event bus to support *.error and *.success patterns
Context: Notification system needed to listen to error events from any module

Prompt Engineering Strategy
Specificity: Provided clear context about Module Federation and React

Iteration: Started with broad concepts and refined based on responses

Examples: Included code examples from existing implementation for better suggestions

Constraints: Specified TypeScript, Webpack 5, and React 18 requirements

üé® Features Implemented

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Short-term Improvements
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for better development experience

Persistent storage for users and notifications

Advanced chart visualizations for analytics

Enhanced error reporting and logging

Long-term Roadmap
Authentication and authorization system

Advanced state management with Redux or Zustand

End-to-end testing with Cypress

Performance monitoring and optimization

Docker containerization for easy deployment

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Decisions
Simplifications Made
In-memory data storage instead of persistent database

Basic CSS styling instead of comprehensive UI library

Mock chart data instead of real analytics integration

Simple error reporting instead of advanced monitoring

Technology Choices
Webpack 5 Module Federation: For microfrontend architecture

TypeScript: For type safety across modules

Custom Event Bus: For lightweight communication without external dependencies

React Error Boundaries: For error isolation between modules

üìù Assumptions
Development environment with Node.js and npm is available

Modern browser with ES6+ support is used

No Internet Explorer support required

Focus on functionality over comprehensive styling

In-memory state is sufficient for demonstration purposes

üß™ Testing
Run tests for each application:
# In each application folder
npm test
